Sorry if this is too long or anything, but I really wanted to share my PC building story over the years with this subreddit. Anyways, heregoes: I have always been a computerphile, I remember being about 7-8 years old in the 2nd grade and having a family friend donate us a Windows 3.1 computer and being completely mesmerized with how it worked. I also remember taking it apart one day and experimenting moving around some wires on the inside (which in retrospect I'm pretty sure were panel headers.

The following is a new benchmarking of the graphical performance of latest NVIDIA driver version ( 419.17 ) on a gaming rig with a high-end Pascal GPU. Since this is my first run, I have no previous comparisons this time around. I tried to keep testing as similar to RodroG's as possible, although I did have to cut out some game benchmarks (due to not owning them) and cut the number of passes in half, from 6 to 3. ## Changelog: First iteration of Pascal Performance Benchmarks by me, since.
